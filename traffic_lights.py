	PROBLEM STATMENT : 
	you are given a roadmap of a country consisting of N cities and M roads. Each city has a traffic light, The traffic light has only 2 colors, Green and Red. All the traffic lights will swtich their color from Green to Red and vice cersa after every T seconds. You can cross a city only when the traffic light in the city is Green. Intially, all the lights are Green.At a city if the traffic light is Red, you have to wait for it to switch its color to Green. The time taken to travel through any road is C seconds.

	Input :
	The First Line contains 4 space separated integers, N, M, T and C
	Next M lines contains two integers each U and V denotting that there is a bidirectional road between U and V

	Output:
	Find Out:
	i) Minimum Time
	ii) Shortest Route
	iii) Second Minimum Time
